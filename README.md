# Cellular-Pathways-Enrichment-Analysis
Enrichment analysis results conducted on HCC patients

### Introduction 
In this enrichment analysis, pathways that were affected by differential gene expression were identified for furthe research. 
Following is the discussion and conclusion of the enrichment analysis. 

### Report on Findings About Pathways of Interest with Liver Cancer Patient Data Analysis

#### Objective: 
After conducting enrichment analysis on liver cancer patient dataset, the following pathways are some of the major pathways to be influenced by genetic alterations. 

#### Findings (Important Pathways Related to Liver Cancer): 
##### 1.	Ferroptosis 
(from KEGG data analysis tool; overlap gene 2/41, p-value 0.01 & from WikiPathway; overlap 2/40, p-value 0.0096)
- According to a study, FSP1, a ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 which was identified as part of a protective mechanism against ferroptosis, was significantly overexpressed in hepatocarcinoma cancer cells1). 
- This study along with the analysis findings from this assignment, could indicate that ferroptosis is an important pathway related to the advancement of liver cancer. 
- Since the gene expression level of genes related to this pathway was different between early stage liver cancer patients and advanced liver cancer patients, this could also be an indication of this pathway to liver cancer progress. 
##### 2.	Regulation of Actin Cytoskeleton 
(from KEGG data analysis tool; overlap gene 3/218, p-value 0.047 & from WikiPathway; overlap 3/150, p-value 0.018)
- Hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC) is characterized by high incidence of metastasis and actin cytoskeleton serves as a reticular scaffold supporting cell space and also participates in regulations including migration, invasion, and cargo transport in terms of HCC invasion and metastasis2). 
- The aforementioned study aligns with the analysis result, placing actin cytoskeleton regulation in one of the top positions regarding HCC.
